## Write an application that tracks daily expenses of users

- [x] User must be able to create an account and log in. (If a mobile application, this means that more users can use the app from the same phone).

- [x] When logged in, a user can see, edit and delete his expenses he entered.

- [x] When an expense record is entered, each one has: date, time, description, amount, comment.

- [x] User can filter expenses by dates from-to, description, comment.

- [x] User can print expenses per week with the total amount and average day spending.

- [x] Minimal UI/UX design is needed. You will not be marked on graphic design. However, do try to keep it as tidy as possible.

### Bonus: unit and e2e tests.

- [x] e2e test for REST API.
- [ ] unit and e2e test for client app.

 Note: Please note that this is the project that will be used to evaluate your skills. The project will be evaluated as if you were delivering it to a customer. We expect you to make sure that the app is fully functional and doesnâ€™t have any obvious missing pieces.
